## Definition
General-purpose computing on graphics processing units(GPGPU) is a computer having lots of cores used to execute numerical calculation.

GPGPU is extension of graphics processing units(GPU) which developed for print text and graphics data to a monitor in 1996 and used game development now.

In 2001, it has been able to program GPU by the appearance of computing device, "GeForce3".

From 2006, GPU has been used to calculate e.g. numerical simulation and machine learning.
